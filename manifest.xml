  <description brief="EchoTree: Display word tree as user types">

     EchoTree helps conversation with mute persons, who can type.
     A statistically driven word tree visualization is visible to 
     the voice enabled conversation partner P. The tree continuously
     updates as the mute person M types on their screen. P can then
     guess and call out what M might be wishing to type. The system
     works for in-person conversations and over the telephone.
