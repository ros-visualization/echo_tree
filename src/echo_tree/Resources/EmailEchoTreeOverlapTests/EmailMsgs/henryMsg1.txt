this demonstrates a couple things;
it appears to be disruptive technology [but i need to demo it to be sure];
it shows how products for the disabled can lead t0 commercial products for the general population;
it really stresses how technology is an anti dote for depression among the disabled;
it does not require HEAD movement, only EYE

some draw backs;
it only works with Windows [UGH]
it still requires a computer screen 18" in front of your face
i doubt it is faster than my current headtracker or more precise [but i need to play with one to be sure]
