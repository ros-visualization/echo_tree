we met with Joe K today [the quad with MS]
He's a very interesting guy.
He was extremely interested in RfH, but we kind of overwhelmed him, so it is hard to say exactly what he was most excited about
He will write,and we talked about getting together socially

Steve also did a great job with Marco's kids[Marco is the electrician who saved our butts-he never did bill us]
